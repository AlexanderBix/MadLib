Running:

  -Run program by typing './MadLib' (Without the quotes)
  -The program will then prompt the user into entering a file name. Enter
  the file name you wish to use and the extension of the file. The File
  'test.txt' has been provided to test this with.
  -The program will then prompt the user to enter a word of a certain
  type. (Such as noun, verb, adjective, etc). This will continue until
  there are no more words that need to be entered. 
  -The program will then display the output of the MadLib and generate
  a file named 'output.txt' with the output of the MadLib.

  Enter 'y' to continue or 'n' to quit.
  
  Creating a MadLib: 
    -This program was designed to work with user-generated MadLibs. To
    create a MadLib, first make a text file. Then type what you want it
    to say.
    -When you encounter a spot where you want the user to enter a word,
    type '#WORD#' (without quotation marks), and with changing WORD with 
    they type of word you wish the user to enter. (For example, #Noun#,
    #Verb#, etc).
   
  Limitations:
    -Program will only save the last MadLib done to 'output.txt'.
